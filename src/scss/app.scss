/**
 * Bootstrapper
 * 
 * This bootstraps globals and base only. React views and components
 * import their respective .scss files directly in the .js. All views and
 * components utilise css modules (https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
 * 
 * Variables, mixins etc should all be called directly from the .scss using them.
 * E.g. @import '~variables' to include variables in the .scss
